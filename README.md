This study examines the impact of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector growth on youth career choices in post-Soviet Armenia from 2010 to 2024. The research uses fixed effects regression analysis to investigate the relationship between ICT sector performance, expressed by trade volume, and undergraduate applications to sector-relevant STEM and non-STEM faculties at Yerevan State University. Data were collected from national sources and university records. The findings reveal that ICT sector growth is associated with increased applications in only sector-specific STEM faculties, while lowering the applications in non-technical fields. This study contributes to understanding how emerging industries in transition economies can shape educational preferences, offering insights for policymakers and educators in Armenia and similar contexts.
