### Abstract <br>
This study examines the impact of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector growth on youth career choices in post-Soviet Armenia from 2010 to 2024. The research uses fixed effects regression analysis to investigate the relationship between ICT sector performance, expressed by trade volume, and undergraduate applications to sector-relevant STEM and non-STEM faculties at Yerevan State University. Data were collected from national sources and university records. The findings reveal that ICT sector growth is associated with increased applications to only sector-relevant STEM faculties, while lowering the applications in rest of the faculties. The study contributes to understanding how emerging industries in transition economies can shape educational preferences, offering insights for policymakers and educators in Armenia and similar contexts.
